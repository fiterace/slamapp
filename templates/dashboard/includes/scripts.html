and hindering your way. 4 years isn't a small time, yet when you look back, tons of things are still left to be completed and cherished. \
As Naina told you years back, \"Life mein jitna bhi try kar lo kuchh Na kuchh to chhutega hi!!!\" \
So here is the team of Litsoc, re-creating memories from jam nights to game nights and \" *_baba ki Bakar\" , \"Param sir\'s wittiness\", \"Shivam sir's literature\", \"Chirag sir's lapdance\", \
\"Siddharth sir ki vocabulary\"_* and other great names with great talents. \
To our Litsoc seniors, I know you have missed a lot. Your dreams of last semester\'s tomfoolery, last college trips with your friends, \
last hug from your college juniors on your last day of college, graduation dinners, GPL of friends, and a lot lot lot more. For four years, \
IIT Mandi proved to be not just your college but your home, juniors were not just students but your siblings, \
alumni were not just seniors but your guardians in times of crisis and colleagues were not just friends but proved to be brothers and sisters. \
Though everything was not as beautiful as I'm writing, I know it was full of ups and downs and at times you fought them all alone despite being surrounded by everyone, \
and yet you pulled out the best out of yourselves and cheerfully succeeded to make it to your final year. \
I know it would be a nightmare for you all to wake up one day just 5 minutes before 9 and instead of rushing to your classes in loose pyjamas and sleepy eyes, \
you all would be rushing to your office with unknotted ties and messed up files in your folder.\
But you know, you would prove to be the best of all batches because you have witnessed the pain of separation, devastation, rejection , denial and distances. \
You are the ones who will have multiple success stories to tell to your next generations because you knew how to make things work despite miles of physical distance from each other and be so close. \
This lockdown taught mankind millions of small things and you are the ones who were hit and got over it.\

= Pagination short logic description =
 
  We set collection of our pages as an array of objects.
  Each object is a page with properties:
    * id - used as identifier
    * text - HTML page content
    * active - flag for page that is currently rendered.
 
  Logic is to check which object is flagged active and render that page.
 
  Page gets flagged as active by button click events.
 
  Buttons are rendered according to pages - for every page we create one button with:
    * corresponding number as text
    * corresponding ID as a button title.
 
  Rest are button click events for switching pages.

All that you have to do is shake your mind until the best memory peeps out. Write down every memory that you have wished to recreate or cherish with them when in college.
